      <h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
      <br>
      <p><span style = "font-weight: bold">Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone</span> was born on July 6th, 1946 in Manhattan, New York City. His mother's obstetricians had to use forceps during his birth due to some complications. Misuse of these accidentally severed a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of his face.  As a result, the lower left side of his face is paralyzed – including parts of his lip, tongue, and chin – an accident which has given Stallone his snarling look and slightly slurred speech.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Stallone was baptized Catholic. His father moved the family to Washington, D.C. in the early 1950s, where he opened a beauty school. His mother opened a women's gymnasium called Barbella's in 1954. He attended Notre Dame Academy and Lincoln High School in Philadelphia, and Charlotte Hall Military Academy, prior to attending Miami Dade College and the University of Miami.</p>

      <h3 id="beginning">1969–1971: The beginning</h3>
      <br>
      <p>While Stallone was in Switzerland, he played a restaurant patron, in a scene with Robert Redford and Camilla Sparv, in the sports drama, Downhill Racer (1969). Stallone had his first starring role in the soft core pornography feature film The Party at Kitty and Stud's (1970). He was paid US$200 for two days' work. Stallone later explained that he had done the film out of desperation after being evicted from his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days. He has also said that he slept three weeks in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City prior to seeing a casting notice for the film. In the actor's words, "it was either do that movie or rob someone, because I was at the end – the very end – of my rope".</p>

      <h3 id="early-film-roles">1970–1975: Early film roles</h3>
      <br>
      <p>In 1972, Stallone appeared in the film No Place to Hide, which was re-cut and retitled Rebel, the second version featuring Stallone as its star. After the style of Woody Allen's What's Up, Tiger Lily?, this film, in 1990, was re-edited from outtakes from the original movie and newly shot matching footage, then redubbed into an award-winning parody of itself titled A Man Called... Rainbo.</p>

      <br>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rocky-Poster-whole-million-24x36/dp/B000HE2ZUW" target="_blank"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NNabHp%2BsL._SL1001_.jpg" alt="" id="rocky__poster"></a>
      <p>Stallone gained worldwide fame with his starring role in the smash hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky" target="_blank">Rocky</a> (1976). On March 24, 1975, Stallone saw the Muhammad Ali–Chuck Wepner fight. That night Stallone went home, and after three days and 20 straight hours, he had written the script, but Stallone subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Stallone attempted to sell the script to multiple studios, with the intention of playing the lead role himself. Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone US$350,000 for the rights, but had their own casting ideas for the lead role, including Robert Redford and Burt Reynolds. Stallone refused to sell unless he played the lead character and eventually, after a substantial budget cut to compromise, it was agreed he could be the star.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Rocky was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Directing and Best Film Editing.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p>Stallone made his directorial debut and starred in the 1978 film Paradise Alley, a family drama in which he played one of three brothers who enter the world of wrestling. That same year he starred in Norman Jewison's F.I.S.T., a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modeled on James Hoffa, who becomes involved in the labor union leadership.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In 1979 he wrote, directed and starred in the sequel to his 1976 hit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_II"  target="_blank">Rocky II</a>, which also became a major success, grossing US$200 million.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Stallone launched another major franchise success, starring as Vietnam veteran John Rambo, a former Green Beret, in the action-war film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Blood" target="_blank">First Blood</a> (1982). The first installment of Rambo was both a critical and box office success. Three Rambo sequels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo:_First_Blood_Part_II" target="_blank">Rambo: First Blood Part II</a> (1985), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_III" target="_blank">Rambo III</a> (1988) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_(2008_film)">Rambo</a> (2008), followed. He also continued his box office success with the Rocky franchise and wrote, directed, and starred in two more 1980s sequels to the series: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_III" target="_blank">Rocky III</a> (1982) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_IV" target="_blank">Rocky IV</a> (1985).</p>
      <br>
      <p>In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen. Stallone claims to have reduced his body fat percentage to his all-time low of 2.8% for Rocky III.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Stallone's 1990s began with starring in the fifth installment of the Rocky franchise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_V" target="_blank">Rocky V</a>. This film brought back the original film's director John G. Avildsen. It was considered a box office disappointment.</p>
      <br>
      <p> In 1993, he made a comeback with the hit Cliffhanger, which was a success in the US, grossing US$84 million, but even more successful worldwide, grossing US$171 million. Later that year, he starred with Wesley Snipes in the futuristic action film Demolition Man, which grossed over US$158 million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's The Specialist (over US$170 million worldwide gross).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Following his breakthrough performance in Rocky, critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next Marlon Brando, though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with Rocky. In 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller Get Carter – a remake of the 1971 British Michael Caine film of the same name—but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films Driven (2001), Avenging Angelo (2002) and D-Tox (2002) also underachieved expectations to do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In 2005, he was the co-presenter, alongside Sugar Ray Leonard, of the NBC Reality television boxing series The Contender. That same year he also made a guest appearance in two episodes of the television series Las Vegas. In 2005, Stallone also inducted wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, who appeared in Rocky III as a wrestler named Thunderlips, into the WWE Hall of Fame; Stallone was also the person who offered Hogan the cameo in Rocky III.</p>

      <br>
      <p>After a three-year hiatus from films, Stallone had a comeback in 2006 with the sixth installment of his successful Rocky series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Balboa_(film)" target="_blank">Rocky Balboa</a>, which was a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box office failure of the previous installment Rocky V, Stallone had decided to write, direct and star in a sixth installment which would be a more appropriate climax to the series. The total domestic box office came to US$70.3 million (and US$155.7 million worldwide). The budget of the movie was only US$24 million. His performance in Rocky Balboa has been praised and garnered mostly positive reviews.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Stallone's fourth installment of his other successful movie franchise is titled simply Rambo. The film opened in 2,751 theaters on January 25, 2008, grossing US$6,490,000 on its opening day and US$18,200,000 over its opening weekend. Its box office was US$113,244,290 worldwide with a budget of US$50 million.</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_(2010_film)" target="_blank">The Expendables</a> was Stallone's big success of 2010. The movie was released on August 13th, 2010. Stallone wrote, directed and starred in the movie. Joining him in the film were fellow action stars Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren, as well as Terry Crews, Mickey Rourke, Randy Couture, Eric Roberts, and Stone Cold Steve Austin, and cameos by fellow '80s action icons Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie took US$34,825,135 in its opening weekend, going straight in at No. 1 in the US box office. The figure marked the biggest opening weekend in Stallone's career. A sequel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2" target="_blank">The Expendables 2</a> was released August 17, 2012, to a positive critical reception of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes, as opposed to the original's 41%. As well as returning cast members from the first film, the ensemble cast also included Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/Creed_poster.jpg" alt="Creed poster" id="creed__poster">
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_3" target="_blank">The Expendables 3</a>, the third installment in the ensemble action film series was released on August 15, 2014.

In 2015, Stallone reprised his role as Rocky Balboa in a spin-off-sequel film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_(film)" target="_blank">Creed</a>, which focused on the son of his deceased friend/rival, Apollo Creed, becoming a boxer. Portraying the iconic cinematic boxer for the seventh time, Stallone's portrayal of the character received widespread acclaim and accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, and his third Academy Award nomination; this time for Best Supporting Actor.</p>
      <br>
      <p>On July 21, 2017, Stallone confirmed that he had completed a script for a sequel to Creed, featuring the return of Ivan Drago from Rocky IV. He is also working on an Escape Plan 3, which would be the fourth character he has portrayed for a third time, after Rocky Balboa, John Rambo, and Barney Ross. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_II" target="_blank">Creed II</a> went into production in March 2018, with an aim for a release on Thanksgiving.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="injuries">Injuries</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Stallone has suffered numerous injuries during his acting career. For a scene in Rocky IV, he told Dolph Lundgren "Punch me as hard as you can in the chest." "Next thing I know, I was in intensive care at St. John's Hospital for four days. It's stupid!" While filming a fight scene with actor and professional wrestler Steve Austin in The Expendables, he broke his neck, which required the insertion of a metal plate. During the filming of Escape to Victory, Stallone broke a finger trying to save a penalty kick from Pelé.</p>
